# Hybrid Energy Demand Forecasting (XGBoost + LSTM)

> A time series machine learning project combining the power of tree-based models and deep learning to accurately forecast electricity demand.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

It is a hybrid energy forecasting project that leverages both **XGBoost** and **LSTM** models to predict electricity demand using historical consumption data and time-based engineered features.

The idea is to ensemble both approaches to improve robustness, accuracy, and temporal learning â€” ideal for smart grid applications and energy demand management.

## ðŸš€ Models Used

| Model       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **XGBoost** | Uses lag features, rolling statistics, calendar-based features for tabular modeling. |
| **LSTM**    | Captures long-term temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in consumption. |
| **Ensemble**| Combines XGBoost + LSTM predictions to reduce variance and improve accuracy. (WIP)|
